# **PharmaNet: Pharmaceutical discovery with deep recurrent neural networks.**

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of PharmaNet, presented in the paper [PharmaNet: Pharmaceutical discovery with deep recurrent neural networks](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0241728). PharmaNet is a novel approach for the task of Drug-Protein interaction based on Recurrent Neural Networks to analyze SMILES representations drugs.
